            <h1>Un peu d'histoire sur ce sport méconnu</h1>
            <p id="texte">Au XVIe siècle, la boxe thaïlandaise faisait partie de l'entraînement militaire. <br> Le roi Naresuan le grand (r. 1590-1605) aurait encouragé sa pratique à ce titre. <br> Il atteignit sa plus grande popularité au début du XVIIIe siècle, sous le règne de Pra Chao Sua, « le Roi Tigre ». <br>
            Elle est surnommée l'« art des huit membres » en référence aux huit parties utilisées des bras et des jambes2. <br> Les pratiquants sont appelés nak muays.</p>
            
            
               <h2>Introduction</h2> 

               <p> Thai boxing, also known as Muay Thai or Siamese boxing, is a martial art native to Thailand. It's one of the oldest forms of kick has practiced for centuries by both men and women in Southeast Asia.\
                Thai Boxing originated from Krabi Krabong which means "to knock down" or "to break wood" in Thai language. The art was created by warriors who used their bare hands against swordsmen during battles between rival kingdoms throughout ancient times until it became an organized sport during the reigns of King Rama V (1868-1910) and King Rama VI (1910-25).</p>
                
                <h2>The Rules of Thai Boxing</h2> 
                
                <p>Thai boxing is a form of martial arts that originated in Thailand. It's been around for centuries and has evolved over time, but it still retains many of its original elements.\
                Thai boxers compete in matches with rules similar to those used in Western boxing matches: they wear gloves and headgear, their hands are wrapped before each round (called "wrapping"), they fight on a circular ring called a mongkol or ring rope, they must touch their opponent's body at least 3 times during each round (this means you can't just hit someone once and expect them to fall down), etc... The biggest difference between Muay Thai and Kickboxing is that Muay Thai allows kicks above the waist while kickboxing only allows kicks below the waistline (but not always). Another difference is that kickboxers wear shin guards whereas Muay Thai fighters do not have any protection on their shins whatsoever because they rely more heavily on kicking than punching when fighting against another person who knows how to block punches well enough so as not get hit by them often enough where getting injured would happen often enough too frequently which would make things unfair towards both people involved if one person gets hurt more often than another due solely because he/she wasn't wearing protective gear like gloves & headgear which protects both hands & face respectively."</p>
                
                <h2>The History of Muay Thai</h2> 
                
                <p>Muay Thai is a martial art that originated in Thailand. It's known for its use of punches and kicks, as well as knee and elbow strikes. Muay Thai also features grappling techniques such as clinch fighting, throws and takedowns.\
                Muay Thai has been around since at least the 18th century, but it wasn't until the 1920s that it became popular outside of Thailand thanks to King Rama VII who promoted the sport throughout his kingdom. Since then, Muay Thai has become one of the most popular forms of combat sports worldwide with millions of practitioners worldwide today!</p>
                
               <h2>Muay Thai Techniques</h2> 
                
                <p>Muay Thai techniques are used in a variety of situations, including:
                
                *   Stri Techniques - Punching and kicking are the most basic Muay Thai techniques. Punches can be thrown with either hand, but kicks are only performed with the front leg. Kicks can be aimed at the head or body, depending on the angle of attack and range between fighters.
                *   Grappling Techniques - These include throws, sweeps and takedowns that may be used to take down an opponent so that you can get closer for better striking opportunities or apply ground-and-pound from top position (on top). They also include submissions such as armlocks/wristlocks/chokes which are used to force opponents into submission by causing pain or injury rather than simply overpowering them physically like grappling does; these submissions require great skill because they're hard to escape once applied correctly!
                *   Clinch Techniques - This category includes clinching up against the ropes where both fighters try desperately not only avoid being hit also ways around their opponent's defenses while trying their hardest not get hit themselves!"</p>
